00h00m00.000sec,00h00m00.700sec,I love it.
00h00m00.860sec,00h00m02.620sec,"Alright, jobs will be a hobby."
00h00m02.980sec,00h00m07.740sec,Elon Musk making another one of his bold predictions about the future and advancements
00h00m07.740sec,00h00m09.140sec,in artificial intelligence.
00h00m09.320sec,00h00m09.779sec,Watch this.
00h00m10.800sec,00h00m12.320sec,Probably none of us will have a job.
00h00m12.699sec,00h00m15.960sec,"If you want to do a job as kind of like a hobby, you need to do a job."
00h00m17.160sec,00h00m22.300sec,But otherwise the AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.
00h00m23.199sec,00h00m24.440sec,"Yeah, Musk wasn't done there."
00h00m24.660sec,00h00m29.260sec,The billionaire also given a master class on how to shut down a liberal media reporter.
00h00m30.160sec,00h00m30.920sec,"Hi, Elon."
00h00m31.199sec,00h00m33.039sec,Spreah Shavastra from Business Insider.
00h00m33.939sec,00h00m35.000sec,Taking into Tesla.
00h00m35.259sec,00h00m41.460sec,"Tesla's had a bumpy few months looking at flagging sales at home, stock market decline, layoffs."
00h00m41.880sec,00h00m43.719sec,"When you look back, are there any things?"
00h00m43.780sec,00h00m47.759sec,We can stop the question right now because I don't think business insiders are a real
00h00m47.759sec,00h00m48.140sec,publication.
00h00m48.820sec,00h00m48.939sec,Okay.
00h00m49.140sec,00h00m50.399sec,So let's do one for the next question.
00h00m50.740sec,00h00m51.380sec,"Alright, thank you."
00h00m51.659sec,00h00m53.119sec,So next question number four.
00h00m55.520sec,00h00m57.979sec,"Yeah, he's Steve Jowls one minute and I'll drop the next."
00h00m57.979sec,00h01m01.740sec,"Alright, but is artificial intelligence ready for prompt time?"
00h01m02.060sec,00h01m08.239sec,"After Google's woke AI disaster, the tech giant's new AI search prompt is facing criticism"
00h01m08.239sec,00h01m12.540sec,for telling folks to put glue in their pizza and eat rocks.
00h01m14.660sec,00h01m16.379sec,I got a five year old.
00h01m16.500sec,00h01m20.379sec,"She's, she's level to do both, but she did it on a more serious topic."
00h01m20.680sec,00h01m25.359sec,I think what Elon was saying is if a robot's doing your job and you don't really like
00h01m25.359sec,00h01m28.680sec,"your job, anyway, you can dedicate your time to things you are passionate about."
00h01m29.040sec,00h01m32.120sec,"Well, this reminded me I was thinking about when Speaker Pelosi, when they were trying"
00h01m32.120sec,00h01m35.239sec,"to get, when she was then Speaker Pelosi, was trying to get the Affordable Care Act passed"
00h01m35.239sec,00h01m37.799sec,"and she said, we got to do this so people aren't tied to jobs."
00h01m37.959sec,00h01m38.519sec,So they have health care.
00h01m38.640sec,00h01m41.239sec,"So if they want to be artists or take pictures all day, they can do that."
00h01m41.620sec,00h01m44.760sec,"Well, my question is, if you're just doing hobbies, how are you paying the rent?"
00h01m44.900sec,00h01m48.319sec,"If the robots are doing the jobs, I don't understand where the income is coming from."
00h01m48.319sec,00h01m49.079sec,It's got to be universal.
00h01m49.579sec,00h01m49.840sec,They come.
00h01m50.099sec,00h01m52.620sec,Who's the guy that ran for Democratic nominee?
00h01m53.280sec,00h01m53.620sec,Andrew James.
00h01m53.920sec,00h01m54.319sec,Andrew James.
00h01m54.319sec,00h01m55.120sec,You think about him?
00h01m55.219sec,00h01m55.780sec,It's got to be that.
00h01m56.159sec,00h02m00.019sec,"Greg, I had a deeper question for you because I felt like you really are bringing it today."
00h02m00.980sec,00h02m02.579sec,So I was on a flight this morning with this guy.
00h02m02.900sec,00h02m04.060sec,He went to Penn.
00h02m04.319sec,00h02m06.519sec,He seems to be a real estate mogul from what I could tell.
00h02m06.840sec,00h02m11.060sec,"And once he started talking to me, he said that he's invested in an AI that will take"
00h02m11.060sec,00h02m13.860sec,the bias out of the media we can consume.
00h02m14.599sec,00h02m17.639sec,And my rebuttal to him was that we all read the Second Amendment.
00h02m17.900sec,00h02m20.080sec,"The text started the facts, but we read it differently."
00h02m20.539sec,00h02m22.060sec,So can AI do that?
00h02m22.199sec,00h02m23.780sec,Can AI settle those arguments?
00h02m23.780sec,00h02m26.180sec,"That is an excellent question, Joey."
00h02m26.879sec,00h02m31.039sec,Right now we're watching AI reach basic super intelligence.
00h02m31.740sec,00h02m39.639sec,"I was listening to Scott Adams debate, chat GPT, over the 2020 election potential illegalities."
00h02m40.080sec,00h02m41.819sec,"It was freaky, right?"
00h02m41.979sec,00h02m44.199sec,Because it came with its own biases.
00h02m44.879sec,00h02m48.479sec,And that Scott had to like tease it out because he knew where he was getting the information
00h02m48.479sec,00h02m48.800sec,from.
00h02m48.979sec,00h02m50.340sec,So it's garbage and garbage out.
00h02m50.479sec,00h02m51.800sec,That's the way it's going to be with AI.
00h02m51.800sec,00h02m58.520sec,"But what was chilling to me was every time Scott cut off chat GPT, I felt that it was"
00h02m58.520sec,00h02m58.860sec,rude.
00h02m59.819sec,00h03m02.900sec,"So I, the chat GPT had a female voice."
00h03m02.900sec,00h03m04.819sec,She was very bubbly and accommodating.
00h03m05.000sec,00h03m11.300sec,"And every time he interjected, I kind of like thought, oh, I hope she doesn't take it personally."
00h03m11.599sec,00h03m16.879sec,"And I realized my God, I was assigning consciousness to something that isn't real."
00h03m17.060sec,00h03m18.419sec,I don't have to do that to my toaster.
00h03m18.580sec,00h03m20.259sec,I don't do that to my fridge or my car.
00h03m20.780sec,00h03m25.520sec,But I assigned consciousness to something that apparently is unconscious.
00h03m26.080sec,00h03m31.759sec,"But if you program AI to act like it's conscious, we're all going to be like this."
00h03m31.919sec,00h03m32.400sec,So get this.
00h03m32.919sec,00h03m35.259sec,"You jump forward 10 years, maybe five years."
00h03m35.340sec,00h03m39.639sec,"You're going to have a mobile AI, a thinking robot in your house that's programmed to understand"
00h03m40.180sec,00h03m44.340sec,"your needs, your likes, dislikes, also your politics."
00h03m44.800sec,00h03m49.879sec,"So if you like Fox News and NASCAR, your robot's going to be listening to country music too."
00h03m49.879sec,00h03m51.819sec,And it's going to understand your philosophies.
00h03m51.960sec,00h03m58.020sec,"So this AI robot will be your friend, your therapist, your coworker."
00h03m58.439sec,00h04m03.259sec,"Imagine if someone comes over and kicks your robot, you're going to react as though somebody"
00h04m03.259sec,00h04m05.879sec,hit your dog or hit your child.
00h04m06.139sec,00h04m08.000sec,You will have assigned it consciousness.
00h04m08.460sec,00h04m13.439sec,And you will think that it experiences pain even though you have no proof that it does.
00h04m13.919sec,00h04m17.519sec,But maybe you could program that the AI into thinking it feels pain.
00h04m17.519sec,00h04m20.060sec,"So you're going to, and this is where it gets freaky."
00h04m21.300sec,00h04m27.120sec,You're going to give it an assignment as a living thing and you're going to expand the
00h04m27.120sec,00h04m28.519sec,definition of living things.
00h04m28.740sec,00h04m33.620sec,"So you basically in the theory of evolution or the concept of evolution, birthing the"
00h04m33.620sec,00h04m36.480sec,next hominem and we're going to be the Neanderthals.
00h04m36.899sec,00h04m39.420sec,No one said in evolution that it had to be made a flesh.
00h04m40.600sec,00h04m42.139sec,I don't know where to take that.
00h04m42.259sec,00h04m42.939sec,I'm going to let it sit.
00h04m43.959sec,00h04m44.660sec,I'm terrified.
00h04m45.240sec,00h04m45.720sec,I don't know.
00h04m45.720sec,00h04m47.740sec,But I kind of want a moody robot in my house.
00h04m47.939sec,00h04m49.279sec,You're talking about what they learned.
00h04m49.500sec,00h04m51.480sec,You will not have a chance kicking that robot.
00h04m51.819sec,00h04m52.899sec,I'm not a anger.
00h04m53.120sec,00h04m54.279sec,You're going to have a liberal robot.
00h04m54.600sec,00h04m56.019sec,I'm going to have a conservative robot.
00h04m56.379sec,00h04m57.660sec,Or we're not going to get along with them.
00h04m57.980sec,00h04m59.459sec,"Well, we already, Kevin, we already have that."
00h04m59.660sec,00h05m00.139sec,We have these.
00h05m00.439sec,00h05m04.600sec,And Elon Musk sits here and says that and he talks about free speech and wanting people
00h05m04.600sec,00h05m05.220sec,to have conversations.
00h05m05.220sec,00h05m09.699sec,"But if I go on X, everything I see is programmed by the people I follow and the things"
00h05m09.699sec,00h05m10.220sec,I tweet.
00h05m10.360sec,00h05m10.800sec,So is that really true?
00h05m10.819sec,00h05m13.240sec,You and I probably won't see much of the same stuff.
00h05m13.959sec,00h05m15.839sec,"I mean, where does this go?"
00h05m16.040sec,00h05m17.439sec,"I mean, we talk about how to vided our country."
00h05m17.620sec,00h05m19.759sec,It seems like AI is the path to complete division.
00h05m20.000sec,00h05m23.319sec,"One of the best things that, so as Shannon knows, I just got married in February."
00h05m23.620sec,00h05m25.500sec,"My husband is Republican, worked at the RNC."
00h05m26.519sec,00h05m31.740sec,So I go on to his Twitter to see what the world view is on his phone and he goes on mine.
00h05m31.740sec,00h05m36.480sec,And I think that's like a worthy experiment to see what the other side.
00h05m36.480sec,00h05m40.480sec,And I wish more people would do that and step up on those zones and then we start kicking
00h05m40.480sec,00h05m41.180sec,each other's robots.
00h05m41.599sec,00h05m42.680sec,You're going to have to get a separate robot.
00h05m42.680sec,00h05m43.459sec,It's a great point.
00h05m44.279sec,00h05m45.600sec,Or they're just going to go at it.
00h05m46.019sec,00h05m46.620sec,Rock and sock them.
00h05m46.699sec,00h05m46.860sec,Yeah.
00h05m47.939sec,00h05m49.920sec,"But it is an interesting question, certainly."
00h05m50.220sec,00h05m52.040sec,"Well, then why did Democrats want it so much?"
00h05m53.120sec,00h05m53.779sec,I don't know if we want it.
00h05m54.060sec,00h05m56.040sec,"Yeah, I'm scared about the future with AI."
00h05m56.240sec,00h06m01.120sec,"Not in the like destroying humans terminator scenario, but this is going to take a lot of jobs,"
00h06m01.339sec,00h06m01.720sec,right?
00h06m02.319sec,00h06m03.639sec,And we're not prepared for that.
00h06m03.699sec,00h06m08.540sec,"I actually think Fox does a good job shining a light on all aspects of AI as a news outlet,"
00h06m08.540sec,00h06m08.779sec,right?
00h06m08.779sec,00h06m09.680sec,You go on Fox digital.
00h06m09.800sec,00h06m11.399sec,There's a ton of AI coverage.
00h06m12.040sec,00h06m13.699sec,But this is going to transform everything.
00h06m13.899sec,00h06m18.259sec,"But if you have a, okay, let's say you have a robot doing your job, somebody has to oversee"
00h06m18.259sec,00h06m19.860sec,that robot and that will be you.
00h06m20.480sec,00h06m21.100sec,We hope.
00h06m21.339sec,00h06m21.920sec,Or Shannon Ray.
00h06m23.400sec,00h06m25.240sec,Because I want my robot to be kind.
00h06m26.200sec,00h06m29.519sec,"Judges, someone who's a little bit robot myself, I don't just hate it."
00h06m30.040sec,00h06m36.000sec,"But on the topic of AI itself, I can't imagine someone using an algorithm to the side of"
00h06m36.000sec,00h06m39.079sec,"the court case sitting on the bench, sitting there listening to our."
00h06m39.259sec,00h06m40.819sec,I will be forever employed.
00h06m40.819sec,00h06m42.300sec,"Well, though I'm not a judge anymore."
00h06m43.319sec,00h06m44.680sec,But you need judges.
00h06m44.680sec,00h06m45.399sec,Why you left?
00h06m45.620sec,00h06m47.019sec,Because I disagree completely.
00h06m47.279sec,00h06m51.639sec,There are studies that show that judge decisions are based on if they ate beforehand.
00h06m52.240sec,00h06m56.519sec,You have to worry about that with the way that my sentence was determined by whether or
00h06m56.519sec,00h06m57.459sec,not I had a milk tea.
00h06m57.459sec,00h06m58.240sec,You were angry.
00h06m58.399sec,00h06m59.500sec,You're angry right now.
00h06m59.959sec,00h07m00.480sec,You're angry.
00h07m01.680sec,00h07m02.060sec,You're angry.
00h07m02.060sec,00h07m05.160sec,I want to say something about this.
00h07m05.459sec,00h07m10.779sec,The billionaire told parents to limit the amount of time their kids spend on social media
00h07m10.779sec,00h07m11.420sec,and no kidding.
00h07m11.879sec,00h07m16.079sec,Because they're being programmed by a dopamine maximizing AI.
00h07m16.800sec,00h07m20.560sec,And that AI will be smarter than any human by the end of 2025.
00h07m21.420sec,00h07m25.600sec,"So if they're smarter than any of us and I'm not real good with this stuff, then they're"
00h07m25.600sec,00h07m28.579sec,going to get rid of me because they think that they're smarter than I.
00h07m28.939sec,00h07m29.279sec,Okay.
00h07m29.279sec,00h07m34.120sec,But I'm smarter than they are because I'm not buying one unless it wants to do my
00h07m34.120sec,00h07m34.860sec,floor like that.
00h07m35.060sec,00h07m36.779sec,What's that thing I have that goes around?
00h07m37.019sec,00h07m38.060sec,We don't have that Alexa.
00h07m38.060sec,00h07m39.160sec,But you have an Alexa.
00h07m39.660sec,00h07m39.899sec,Huh?
00h07m40.120sec,00h07m40.879sec,Do you have an Alexa or something?
00h07m40.980sec,00h07m41.420sec,Absolutely.
00h07m41.759sec,00h07m42.339sec,I don't want to be.
00h07m42.379sec,00h07m43.980sec,Everyone's Alexa's just went off at home.
00h07m44.660sec,00h07m46.579sec,I don't want Alexa.
00h07m47.180sec,00h07m48.139sec,I don't get it.
00h07m48.279sec,00h07m49.879sec,I don't know what the benefit is.
00h07m50.040sec,00h07m51.699sec,I like robots that can do jobs.
00h07m52.100sec,00h07m53.600sec,I don't want them thinking for me.
00h07m53.720sec,00h07m54.279sec,I don't want them.
00h07m54.319sec,00h07m55.939sec,Maybe Joe Biden needs AI.
00h07m56.259sec,00h07m56.720sec,I don't know.
00h07m56.899sec,00h07m58.560sec,Maybe that's where I come down on it.
00h07m58.560sec,00h07m58.959sec,All right.
00h07m58.959sec,00h07m59.360sec,I don't know.
00h07m59.439sec,00h08m00.560sec,"Well, we'll figure it out, I guess."
00h08m00.779sec,00h08m04.060sec,"Coming up next, look out for sharks."
00h08m04.540sec,00h08m07.019sec,Jal sided at beaches ahead of Memorial Day.
